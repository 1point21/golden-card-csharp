# The Golden Card

## Background and disclaimer

This repository represents my first ever fully working coding project, written from scratch in C#. The aim is to revive and update the code. There are extensive comments throughout in Swedish as well as many Swedish variable names. I will, over time, update these to English and remove many of the comments, which were solely added to explain my approach to the mentors of my course.

This was the final project for an entry university level course in the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C#.
